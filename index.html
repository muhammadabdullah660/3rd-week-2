    <h1 class="first">Perfect Paragraph</h1>
    <p class="paragraphs">As designers, we are frequently and incorrectly reminded that our job is to “make things pretty.” We are indeed designers
         — not artists — and there is no place for formalism in good
         design. Web design has a function, and that function is to communicate the message for which the Web page was conceived. 
         The medium is not the message.</p>
         <p class="paragraphs">Never is this principle more pertinent than when dealing with type, the bread and butter of Web-borne communication.
              A well-set paragraph of text is not supposed to wow the reader; the wowing should be left to the idea or observation for which
               the paragraph is a vehicle. In fact, the perfect paragraph is unassuming to the point of near invisibility. That is not to say that 
               the appearance of your text should have no appeal at all.
              On the contrary: well-balanced, comfortably read typography is a thing of beauty; it’s just not the arresting sort of beauty that 
              might distract you from reading.</p>
              <p class="paragraphs">As a young industry that champions innovation and rates its practitioners based on their ability to apprehend (sorry, “grok”) 
                  the continual emergence of new technologies, frameworks, protocols and data models, we are not particularly familiar with tradition. 
                  However, the practice of arranging type for optimal pleasure and comfort is a centuries-old discipline. As long ago as 1927, the noted typographer Jan Tschichold 
                  spoke of the typesetting “methods and rules upon which it is impossible to improve” — a set of rules it would be foolish to ignore.</p>
                
                  <h1 class="first">Setting Your Paragraphs</h1>
                  <h2 class="two">THE TYPEFACE</h2>
                  <p class="paragraphs">Your choice of font is important, but the kind of “family” you choose is project-specific, and we won’t discuss it here except to make one point:
                       the conventional wisdom among Web designers that only sans-serif fonts are suitable for body text is just a rule of thumb.
                        Although serif fonts, with their greater complexity, may tend to be less effective at small sizes, there are many other factors to consider. 
                       A diminutive x-height, for example, could impair the readability of a font from either camp. Some serif
                       fonts are highly legible and attractive for paragraph text if they are set properly. Matthew Carter’s screen-sympathetic Georgia is a case in point.</p>
